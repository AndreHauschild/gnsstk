       * defined in IS-GPS-200 section 20.  The results of the addData
       * method (in the navOut argument) may contain any number of
       * GPSLNavAlm, GPSLNavEph, GPSLNavHealth or GPSLNavTimeOffset

       * data is requested via the validity and type filters (see
       * PNBNavDataFactory).
       * @note Currently validity is not checked in any way in this class.
       * @note This class does not enforce sequential subframes in ephemerides.
       * @todo Currently this code enforces strict matching of toa
       *   between SVID 1-32 and 51.  While this helps ensure that the
       *   time stamp of the almanac orbital elements has the correct
       *   week number, it does mean that if you're missing the page
       *   51 for a particular toa, you won't get those almanacs.
       *   This is probably not ideal and likely needs to be enhanced
       *   without significantly increasing the risk of using an
       *   incorrect WNa.
