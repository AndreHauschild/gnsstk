This documentation provides an overview of the python bindings into the GNSSTk
library.
The GNSSTK is a library of support routines designed for use by programmers
developing applications that read and write (particularly in RINEX format),
process and otherwise manipulate GPS data. It is characterized by the following:

- Modern, ANSI C++; highly object oriented
- Uses templates, the Standard Template Library (STL) and iostreams classes
- Portable and platform independent
- Includes full implementation of the RINEX (Receiver Independent Exchange Format) I/O.
